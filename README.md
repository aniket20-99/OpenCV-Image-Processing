# 🖼️ Image Processing with NumPy & OpenCV

Welcome to my repository on **Image Processing**! This project showcases foundational topics and hands-on implementations using **NumPy** and **OpenCV (cv2)**. It is intended for beginners and intermediate learners who are exploring how to manipulate images and video using Python.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Image Processing Using NumPy
- Understanding images as NumPy arrays
- Performing basic operations like slicing, masking, and filtering
- Pixel-wise transformations and array manipulations

### 🔹 Image Processing Using OpenCV
- Color space conversion (BGR to Gray, HSV, etc.)
- Image transformations (resize, rotate, flip)
- Drawing shapes and text on images

### 🔹 Reading, Writing & Displaying Images with `cv2`
- `cv2.imread()`, `cv2.imwrite()`, `cv2.imshow()`
- Image formats and compression
- Managing image windows

### 🔹 Video Capture Using `cv2`
- Capturing video from a webcam
- Saving video files
- Frame-by-frame processing

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **OpenCV (cv2)**
